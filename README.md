# touchScreen
micro-python driver for Digole LCD touch screen

With this unit, the Digole touch screen colour LCD display can be used with micro-python. It is not a port of the Arduino lib, although ineveitably there are similarities.

Development and testing is still going on, so do not consider this yet as a stable release. When it comes to a release with a stable API, such will be announced here.
