# touchScreen
micro-python driver for Digole LCD touch screen

With this unit, the Digole touch screen colour LCD display can be used with micro-python. It is not a port of the Arduino lib, although ineveitably there are similarities.

Development and testing is still going on, so do not consider this yet as a stable release. When it comes to a release with a stable API, such will be announced here.

NOTE: This software is in a usable state yet, even if you may want to 
add a few changes yourself (which I encourage). However, due to the poor 
quality of the hardware, I am forced to discontinue further development. 
The first blow was that the touch screen function is badly supported by 
the hardware. Using i2c, I would say it is not possible to reliably read 
the screen coordinates. I can't say if the other communication modes 
perform better in this respect. Next, the screen stopped functioning and 
only flickers. That, within three weeks of first use. I lost my 
confidence in this make and will find another solution. Therefore, now 
no longer I can test any new code and leave tis project as it is now.
